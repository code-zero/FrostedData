# FrostedData Application Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**FrostedData Philosophy**: A modern data management application that combines Apple's design language with enhanced glass morphism, shimmer effects, and multiple design variations. The application features dynamic theming and customizable layouts while maintaining professional usability.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Light Mode Primary:**
- Primary: #FFFFFF (pure white backgrounds)
- Secondary: #F8F9FA (off-white for subtle contrast)
- Accent: #007AFF (Apple blue for interactive elements)
- Text: #1D1D1F (near-black for optimal readability)
- Border: #E5E5E7 (light grey for subtle divisions)
- Shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) (subtle depth without harshness)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: SF Pro Display (with Inter as fallback)
- **Hierarchy**: Large headings (32px+), medium body text (16-18px), small labels (14px)
- **Weights**: Regular (400) for body, Medium (500) for labels, Semibold (600) for headings

### C. Layout System
**Spacing**: Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 (generous padding philosophy)
- Container max-width with centered alignment
- Card-based layout with consistent 24px+ internal padding
- Minimum 16px spacing between interactive elements

### D. Component Library

**Forms:**
- Large rounded input fields (16px+ border radius)
- Generous internal padding (p-6)
- Subtle border with focus states using Apple blue
- Form containers with frosted glass backdrop blur effects

**Cards:**
- White backgrounds with subtle shadow elevation
- 16px+ rounded corners for premium feel
- Clean internal organization with clear visual hierarchy
- Edit/delete action buttons with Apple blue accent

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Apple blue (#007AFF) with white text
- Secondary: Light grey with dark text
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px height)
- Rounded corners consistent with overall design

**Data Display:**
- Clean list/grid layouts with card-based entries
- Clear visual separation between items
- Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy

### E. Visual Effects

**Frosted Glass:**
- Enhanced backdrop blur effects with dynamic opacity
- CSS `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` for deep frosted effect
- Applied to dropdowns, modals, and luxury design variant elements
- Responsive to light/dark mode with adjusted transparency

**Shimmer Effects:**
- Diagonal shimmer animations moving across glass elements
- `shimmer` class for continuous diagonal light sweep
- `card-shimmer` for hover-triggered shimmer on cards
- `shimmer-glow` for subtle pulsing glow effects
- Automatic light/dark mode adaptation

**Shadows:**
- Adaptive shadow system that responds to design variants
- Luxury variant: Enhanced shadows with larger blur radius
- Minimal variant: Subtle shadows for clean aesthetic
- All shadows automatically adapt to light/dark themes

### F. Animations
**Transitions (0.3s ease):**
- Form submissions and data updates
- Entry additions with smooth slide-in effects
- Deletion animations with fade-out
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Focus transitions on form inputs

**Key Principles:**
- All animations serve functional purposes
- Smooth, natural feeling motion
- Consistent timing across all interactions
- No distracting or excessive effects

## Responsive Behavior
- Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly targets
- Forms adapt gracefully across screen sizes
- Consistent spacing and proportions maintained
- Card layouts stack appropriately on smaller screens

## Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast ratios maintained throughout
- Large, clear touch targets for all interactive elements
- Proper focus states with Apple blue accent
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers

## New Features

### F. Design Variations
**Five Professional Layouts:**
1. **Classic**: Traditional frosted glass with balanced elements
2. **Minimal**: Clean, simple design with subtle effects
3. **Modern**: Contemporary with bold accents and gradients
4. **Compact**: Space-efficient list-focused layout
5. **Luxury**: Premium with enhanced effects and shimmer

### G. Theme System
**Dynamic Light/Dark Mode:**
- System preference detection
- Manual theme toggle with smooth transitions
- All components and effects adapt automatically
- Persistent user preference storage

### H. Advanced Interactions
**Enhanced Animation System:**
- Diagonal shimmer effects on glass elements
- Hover-triggered card shimmer animations
